### What are we About

007 is a crime-fighting, easy-to-use, powerful Dynamic backlink tool. Search engines such as Google crawl through the web and the more websites that point to you (Backlinks) the more your rankings increase. With Google being able to read javascript we are able to emulate this proccess and give everyone and equal chance while doing so. Just copy and paste the javascript and implement links elements in your html with the class "007". Every time the website loads a new link, hopefully, will populate each of the link elements, See Simple. The premise is to get enough people to implement this on their site that when search enignes crawl, every site will have a chance to get at least one reputable backlink. Please, we want to keep this community spam free, so only post reputable site to the backlink submission form. "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you".

### Tips
Try putting the link elements in more obscure parts of you site (where crawlers can find but users can't), you don't know where the link will point next! \__("_")_/
So even though we try to keep the backlinks safe and reputable, please use the link elements safely!
